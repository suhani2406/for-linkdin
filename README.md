## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm Suhani, a passionate software developer and tech explorer with a love for turning ideas into user-friendly digital experiences.

Currently working as a Web Development Intern, I've built everything from animated space portfolios and productivity bots to mini-games and full-stack apps.

I thrive in team environments, love learning, and enjoy combining design with functionality â€” whether it's a landing page, AI integration, or a system of reminders.
